{"name":"OpenCF","tagline":"Open Cluster Framework","body":"### Welcome!\r\nWelcome to the Open Cluster Framework project. The purpose of this project is to define standard clustering APIs for some basic capabilities.\r\n\r\n### Who We Are\r\nWe are a group of people who have interests in cluster software - both providers and consumers of clustering services. We have periodic meetings in person, and an ongoing conversations via a mailing list.\r\n\r\n### Our Approach\r\nWe have two basic thrusts to our work.\r\n\r\n* Define standard APIs for basic clustering functions\r\n* Create and support an open source development project which acts as the reference implementation for the OCF APIs.\r\n\r\n    The established open source reference implementation for High Availability Clusters is [Pacemaker](http://clusterlabs.org).\r\n\r\nIt is also our intent to create APIs which are usable on both High-Performance and High-Availability clusters. It is not our intent to replace or redefine de-facto standards (like MPI or PVM) which are already in common use, and serve their intended purpose well.\r\n\r\n### Intellectual Property Stance\r\nIt is our stance that the OCF APIs themselves must be royalty-free (RF) standards. It is acceptable for individual implementations to use patented or otherwise encumbered techniques, but the standard itself must be reasonably implementable without the use of patented techniques.\r\n\r\n### The Standards\r\nWe are a working group of the Free Standards Group. The standards themselves are intended to be largely platform-independent, capable of being implemented on most POSIX-compliant OSes, but there will be certain sections (kernel APIs for example) which will be platform-specific. Although the standards are intended to be OS-independent, the primary interest of the majority of the group is Linux, and the OS-specific APIs will likely only be defined for Linux initially.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
